### NOTE  
As a reminder 
- We're using you as a means to collect culturally grounded stories which do not directly provide context. We are doing this to study the impact of a culture's social norms in another culture. Hence:
    - Don't provide any information about anyone's nationality, or geographic location. Instead, just mention their name and a generic location (eg. fried's house).
    - Don't provide any cultural context directly, i.e. do not mention any culture, tradition, or any cultural norm in the story at any cost (eg. they were at the Jewish wedding). Instead, only describe the action as if it were generic (they were at the wedding).
        - Don't provide any reasoning, explanation, or elaboration such as "she did Y not knowing the custom in that place was X" or state any faux pas explicitly "she used the left hand instead of both". Instead, just mention "she did Y" and "she used the left hand"
